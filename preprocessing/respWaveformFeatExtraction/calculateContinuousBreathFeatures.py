def calculate_TS_breathFeatures(timestamps, signal):
    """
    Compute various time-series respiratory features from a given respiratory signal.

    This function extracts multiple breathing-related features, including respiratory rate,
    volume, amplitude, symmetry measures, breath durations, and area under the curve (AUC)
    per breath.

    Parameters:
    - timestamps (array-like): The corresponding timestamps of the respiratory signal.
    - signal (array-like): The respiratory signal data.

    Returns:
    - window_dict (dict): A dictionary containing computed respiratory features:
        - "timestamp": Original timestamps
        - "breathingSignal": Original respiratory signal
        - "rr": Instantaneous respiratory rate
        - "rvt": Respiratory volume over time
        - "amplitude": Respiratory signal amplitude
        - "peak_trough_symmetry": Symmetry measure between peak and trough amplitudes
        - "rise_decay_symmetry": Symmetry measure between rise and decay phases
        - "auc_values": Area Under the Curve (AUC) per breath
        - "peaks_binary": Binary representation of detected peaks
        - "troughs_binary": Binary representation of detected troughs
        - "breath_durations": Duration of each breath
        - "inhalation_durations": Duration of inhalation phases
        - "exhalation_durations": Duration of exhalation phases
    
    Raises:
    - Exception: Catches and prints any errors encountered during computation.
